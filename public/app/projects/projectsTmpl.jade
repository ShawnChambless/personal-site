        h2 Grain Billd
    p Grain Billd was my choice for the "personal project" for DevMountain. The personal project was meant to be a full stack web app utilizing all of the MEAN Stack technologies that we learned at DevMountain. Grain Billd is build with AngularJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. User authentication is accomplished via the Passport Local Auth Strategy. I really enjoyed building Grain Billd due to the overwhelming need for a better way to calculate beer recipes, and the lack of a single place to research, calculate, and save the recipes.

        h2 DevMountain Resources    
    p The DevMountain Resources app was also a full stack MEAN project, but with a group this time. It was built with all of the same technologies as Grain Billd was, and all of the learning curve of using git as a group. This is where I really solidified my passion for web development. Developing as a group is the pinnacle of fun at work for me. The project was contracted to my group by DevMountain, and purchased by the school.
