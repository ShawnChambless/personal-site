    <p>I grew up in Moultrie, Georgia. After high school, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Ordnanceman. During my enlistment, I had the privilege of being stationed in Jacksonville, FL, Lemoore, CA, Atsugi, Japan, as well as some short port visits in France, Dubai, Australia, Singapore, Philippines, and China. </p>

    <p>After leaving the Navy, I moved to Vermont to be closer to my mother's side of the family. Although beautiful, the Vermont economy was less than ideal at the time, and eventually I had to get a job as a Correctional Officer. On the first day of the Vermont State Correctional Academy, I met the girl who would become my wife, Angela. After working at the correctional facility for about a year and a half, we decided to go to college at the University of Alaska Anchorage. We packed up her Kia Soul, and hit the road for a 9 day trip to Anchorage.</p>

    <p>While in Anchorage, I attended the University of Alaska Anchorage studying Aviation Maintenance. At some point during the 2 years in Vermont, I picked up homebrewing beer. The only logical progression from beer was soap, so I made an excessive amount of just ok soap. My next thought was that I could sell my soap, so I decided to try my hand at making a website. After finishing the HTML codecademy course, I became obsessed with web development. I began researching and practicing every waking moment instead of listening to lectures and doing homework. Finally, I applied to DevMountain - a 13 week Full Stack dev-bootcamp in Provo, UT.</p>

    <p>I spent the month after applying to&nbsp;<a href="http://devmounta.in" target="_blank" class="devMountainLink">DevMountain</a>&nbsp;anxiously awaiting (read: checking my email approximately every 2 to 3 minutes) the email that would hopefully be my acceptance into the 13 week web dev immersive course. The day that I finally got the email, I was in the middle of replacing an engine on a Cessna 172. I had to stop and literally make a lap in the hangar excitedly telling everyone that I got in. I couldn't believe that my dream had finally come true. I couldn't believe that I was about to embark on a 3 month journey toward my dream career. When the time finally came, I packed up my car and began my second trip on the Alaska Highway.</p>
